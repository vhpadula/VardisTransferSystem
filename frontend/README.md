# VTS Frontend
The Frontend is built with NextJS using its major resources like Server Components, App router and API routes. The architecture is oriented to the Atomic Design. The UI was designed with Figma.
## Figma
The Figma Design page can be found [Here](https://www.figma.com/design/RjgFaDs90oNjny0jRH84sK/VTS?node-id=0-1&t=5ijgxZiGIeL7hGCi-1)
## App Router
The routing system is built in with the folder structure, where every page is contained in the page.tsx file. 
## Atomic Design
Every component is segregated into 3 categories: Atoms, Molecules and Organisms, each with itsa own scale of complexity.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
