# Vardis Transfer System (VTS)

This is a web application for speeding up playtroughs of the Hegemony Board Game, by allowing players to transfer money (Vardis) to each other.

Hegemony is known for its long matches, and most of the time spent in those matches is from the players counting money to pay each other.

The VTS enables not only a automated and real time transfers between players, but also speeds up transactions with the foreign market and IMF game mechanics.

Simply have a device create a room, and all 4 players can join it with the room ID, each with its own class in the game. There is no need to install anything, it all runs on the browser.

By now the app is still in development and only works on Local Networks, but it will soon be deployed to the cloud. More details on the front and backend in their respectiveÂ folders
